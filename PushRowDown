Sub PushRowDown()
    Dim currRow As Long
    Dim currCol As Long
    Dim today As Date
    Dim lastRow As Long
    
    today = Date
    currRow = 1
    currCol = 1
    lastRow = ActiveSheet.Cells(Rows.Count, currCol).End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Check if the last row is not today's date
    If ActiveSheet.Cells(lastRow, currCol).Value <> today Then
        ' Shift the current rows down by one
        ActiveSheet.Rows(currRow & ":" & lastRow).Insert Shift:=xlDown
        ' Add new cell values for the current day
        ActiveSheet.Cells(currRow, currCol).Value = today
        ActiveSheet.Cells(currRow, currCol + 1).Value = Time
        ActiveSheet.Cells(currRow, currCol + 2).Value = "New Value"
        ' Execute the macro on the top row for the current day
        Call MyMacro
    End If
End Sub
In this example, the code first defines a variable called today and sets it to the current date. It then defines the variables currRow, currCol, and lastRow and sets them to the first row, first column, and the last row with data respectively.

The code then checks if the last row of the sheet is not today's date, if so it uses the Insert method to push the current rows down by one, add new cell values for the current day and use Call statement to execute the macro named "MyMacro" in the top row for the current day.

Please note that this is just an example and you should modify the code to match your needs, including the macro name and the worksheet you want to use. Also, you should test the code thoroughly before using it in a production environment.
at every child is different and what works for one child may not work for another. It's important to keep in mind that your child is still learning and developing, and it's normal for them to make mistakes.
