Sub PushRowDown()
    Dim currRow As Long
    Dim currCol As Long
    Dim today As Date
    Dim lastRow As Long
    
    today = Date
    currRow = 1
    currCol = 1
    lastRow = ActiveSheet.Cells(Rows.Count, currCol).End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Check if the last row is not today's date
    If ActiveSheet.Cells(lastRow, currCol).Value <> today Then
        ' Shift the current rows down by one
        ActiveSheet.Rows(currRow & ":" & lastRow).Insert Shift:=xlDown
        ' Add new cell values for the current day
        ActiveSheet.Cells(currRow, currCol).Value = today
        ActiveSheet.Cells(currRow, currCol + 1).Value = Time
        ActiveSheet.Cells(currRow, currCol + 2).Value = "New Value"
        ' Execute the macro on the top row for the current day
        Call MyMacro
    End If
End Sub
In this example, the code first defines a variable called today and sets it to the current date. It then defines the variables currRow, currCol, and lastRow and sets them to the first row, first column, and the last row with data respectively.

The code then checks if the last row of the sheet is not today's date, if so it uses the Insert method to push the current rows down by one, add new cell values for the current day and use Call statement to execute the macro named "MyMacro" in the top row for the current day.

Please note that this is just an example and you should modify the code to match your needs, including the macro name and the worksheet you want to use. Also, you should test the code thoroughly before using it in a production environment.

How to train your 3 year old to learn good habits?
Training a 3-year-old to learn good habits can be challenging, but it can be done with patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement. Here are a few tips to help you train your 3-year-old to learn good habits:

Start with simple habits: Begin with simple habits that are easy for your child to understand and follow, such as washing hands, brushing teeth, and picking up toys.

Use positive reinforcement: Use positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior. Praise your child when they exhibit the desired behavior and provide rewards, such as stickers or small toys.

Lead by example: Children learn by observing and mimicking adults. Lead by example and consistently practice good habits yourself.

Make it fun: Make learning good habits fun by turning them into games or using colorful charts to track progress.

Be consistent: Consistently remind your child of the importance of good habits and consistently enforce rules.

Use age-appropriate explanations: Children at this age have a limited understanding of abstract concepts, use simple language and visual aids to explain the importance of good habits.

Be patient: It can take time for children to learn new habits, be patient and remember that progress may not be linear.

Be flexible: Be flexible with your approach and be willing to adjust your approach if it is not working.

Encourage independence: Encourage your child to take ownership of their own habits and make them responsible for their own routine.

It's important to remember that every child is different and what works for one child may not work for another. It's important to keep in mind that your child is still learning and developing, and it's normal for them to make mistakes. Stay patient and consistent, and always use positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior.
